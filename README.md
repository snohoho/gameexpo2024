[itch.io link](https://daveworks.itch.io/kidd-kewls-crazy-escape)

A game made for Florida Poly's Fall 2024 Game Expo by Jesus De La Rosa, Ethan Davis, Brian Potter, and Alex Hecht.

## Description
Grind rails, punch principals. Sick tricks, combo basketballs. Stop time, chug juice.
Kidd Kewl's tired of school. You should be too. Cool kids don't need school, and the coolest kids break out--in style.
Speedrun and combo your way through your school, calling upon Kidd Kewl's power to freeze time to land sicker tricks and longer combos. Don't let those hall monitors stop your groove; dash your way through or stomp on shoes and combo off those squares as well.

## Controls
Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move me around the screen.
Spacebar will let me jump.
Pressin' Left Shift will allow me to dash in any direction, including up. I only get 2 when I'm off the ground, so use 'em wisely!
Hittin' F will allow me to stop time for up to 5 seconds.
Left Click allows me to preform sick tricks. Holding it after a trick lets me enter a manual.
Holdin' Right Click will open up my inventory and allow me to use the drinks I've got stored by Hovering over them.
